I'm currently a second year undergraduate at the University of Chicago studying computational and applied mathematics, data science, and statistics. I’m involved with various quantitative finance and political science groups on campus.

I have professional interests in trading, quantitative research, and data science. This upcoming summer I will be working as a Quantitative Research Summer Analyst at J.P. Morgan in the Securitized Products Group.

Feel free to reach out!

Professional Experience
------
**Finalyze Capital**<br />
This past summer I worked for Finalyze Capital, which is a fully systematic quantitative CTA that is managed by UChicago alum Joe Fennessey and is co-owned / backed by Mark Cuban. Here, I parameterized and helped implement intraday momentum futures strategies (1.5+ Sharpe). I sourced 10+ profitable strategies for their proprietary trading algorithm and outlined position entry code to backtest on the fund's algorithm. I also researched machine learning algorithmic options / futures trading strategies and presented strategy briefs to the CEO. 

**Acrobator Ventures**<br />
This past summer I also worked at Acrobator Ventures, which is a European VC fund focused on tech and data products. I prioritized a dynamic data set of incoming investment opportunities (deal flow pipeline) matching the fund’s scope. Similarly, I performed analysis on 25+ investment targets (market and competitive analysis, product, business plan, and valuation) and conducted final stage investment research / collaborated with Flow Traders on an OTC RFQ energy trading platform deal.
