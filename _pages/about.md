I'm currently a second year undergraduate at the University of Chicago studying economics and neuroscience. I’m involved with various finance RSOs on campus. I previously attended Hotchkiss School in CT and took a gap year where I explored Australia.

I have professional interests in investment banking, healthcare, and consulting. This upcoming summer I will be working as an analyst at Brookside Equity Partners in Stamford, Connecticut. 

Feel free to reach out!
