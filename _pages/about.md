I'm currently a second year undergraduate at the University of Chicago studying computational and applied mathematics, data science, and statistics. I’m involved with various quantitative finance and political science groups on campus.

I have professional interests in trading, quantitative research, and data science. This upcoming summer I will be working as a Quantitative Research Summer Analyst at J.P. Morgan in the Securitized Products Group.

Feel free to reach out!

Professional Experience

- Finalyze Capital:
This past summer I worked for Finalyze Capital, which is a fully systematic quantitative CTA, where I parameterized and helped implement intraday momentum futures strategies (1.5+ Sharpe). I ultimately sourced 10+ profitable strategies for their proprietary trading algorithm and outlined position entry code to backtest on the fund's algorithm.
